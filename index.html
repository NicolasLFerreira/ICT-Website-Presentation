				Computer Technology in Society: Artificial Intelligence
				Detection, Recognition and Identification on Criminal Justice.
			</h1>
			<p class="text-body">
				Artificial Intelligence refers to using scientific algorithms to
				perform tasks that require human intelligence. It is programmed
				to respond with human interaction, creating proper reasoning,
				generating or analyzing creative media and more. The influence
				of artificial intelligence conquers the ability for society to
				become independent with their responsibilities. The acceleration
				of this technology allows company industries to implement
				machine learning so as to productively invent their products or
				services with ease. Artificial Intelligence has been making
				waves in various industries, and its impact is truly impressive.
				As this innovative technology continues to evolve, its
				capabilities are increasingly in demand, with business and
				individuals alike eagerly seeking ways to enhance their
				operations using Artificial Intelligence. Currently, artificial
				intelligence is freely available to generate images or text to
				the people. If one wishes to have their own structure of
				artificial intelligence software, it can be expensive as custom
				program would require time to work on coding and very detailed
				information to feed into its system.

				According to <b>Mindy Support (2020)</b>, Artificial
				Intelligence in Law and Order is programmed by adding thousands
				of images relating to crime scenes for this machinery to be able
				to identify possible criminal activities. These are used to
				connect possible traces left by criminals in the location of the
				scene.
