				Generally speaking, as technological growth improves its
				purpose, society becomes more reliant on new inventions, making
				it easier for them to handle everyday work. However, the
				benefits of utilizing a machine program can also affect one’s
				independence and lessen their confidence to function without it.

				Based on our findings, the scope of our proposal circulates more
				on work solutions and the conflicts in terms of privacy rights
				and discrimination influenced by Artificial Intelligence
				systems. The use of Artificial Intelligence in the criminal
				justice system brings a mix of advantages and challenges. On the
				one hand, it can make processes more efficient, but on the
				other, it raises significant ethical and legal issues. Due to
				the large amount of personal data the Artificial Intelligence
				systems receive there are ethical concerns around privacy.
				<b>(Alexander and Marion, RUSI, 2009)</b>. These systems biases
				can reinforce discrimination particularly in fields like facial
				recognition.

				But the advantages AI brings should be considered in criminal
				justice because it helps law enforcement work more effectively.
				As stated in the Opportunities, it could anticipate potential
				criminal scenes which will further prevent crimes. AI can also
				analyze information like texts and videos, making investigations
				more accurate which also can make everyone safer if it was to be
				used in public to keep an eye out. It also helps law enforcement
				use their resources better, so it’ll be efficient in helping
				keep the communities safe.

				n conclusion, although there many great aspects of AI these
				Ethical concerns must be addressed if AI was to be considered a
				choice. The legal experts must ensure that the AI system
				algorithms are not to be biased, privacy rights are respected,
				and proper oversight is in place. If the algorithms were to be
				tested and regularly monitored to ensure they are functioning
				properly, only then can Artificial Intelligence be used in an
				ethical manner in Criminal Justice.

				There are also concerns regarding job loss and skill gaps
				because of the growing automation in society. A choice to
				consider is to integrate Artificial Intelligence as a tool to
				assist human decision-makers rather than replacing them
				entirely. This maintains a balance between automation and human
				judgment to ensure accountability and fairness.
