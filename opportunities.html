				There are multiple ways in which Artificial Intelligence
				technologies can help in criminal justice. One scenario already
				in place is reducing the workload of personnel through the
				automation of routine tasks, menial repetitive tasks and generic
				office work such as filing paperwork, data entry, and others,
				making the process more efficient and allowing workers to focus
				on the more important aspects of the job. Another use is in the
				analytical process. Training an Artificial Intelligence model to
				identify patterns in live data collected from surveillance
				systems and other sources before a crime happens could with
				predicting when another one is about to happen and alert law
				enforcement forces to take preventive actions before it happens.
				Another application is in recognition Artificial Intelligence
				systems, for example, face recognition Artificial Intelligence
				models being used on CCTV footage of a crime scene to identify
				all possible suspects, possible crime evidence such as weapons
				and stolen property, voice in systems with sound, etc...
				<b>Christopher Rigano (2019)</b>, "Video analytics for
				integrated facial recognition, the detection of individuals in
				multiple locations via closed-circuit television or across
				multiple cameras, and object and activity detection could
				prevent crimes through movement and pattern analysis, recognize
				crimes in progress, and help investigators identify suspects.".
				Artificial Intelligence systems could also be used for resource
				allocation, such as making decisions on patrol schedules and
				paths according to crime data like location and times, alerting
				officers of suspect identification in live surveillance data
				(refer back to the crime prediction), and with real-time
				assistance in case of conflict, by sending alert signals,
				mobilizing personnel, assisting personnel through buildings and
				locating suspects, etc... <b>Christopher Rigano (2019)</b>, "AI
				technology also has the potential to provide law enforcement
				with situational awareness and context, thus aiding in police
				well-being due to better informed responses to possibly
				dangerous situations.". Artificial Intelligence could also
				assist during the judgement process by providing unbiased
				decisions based solely on the evidence and information related
				to the crime, ignoring preconceptions of race, gender, religion,
				and class that humans are subject to make.

				In the law industry, Artificial Intelligence became very useful
				for crime prevention. Here are the following methods that
				provide great evidence by how this technology can predict or
				make judgement on the scenarios:
			</p>
			<h2 class="category">Video and Image Analysis</h2>
			<p class="text-body">
				This media analysis has a wide purpose: implementing
				safeguarding against torture, strengthening security in the
				area, accountability, and more. It is the responsibility of
				authorities to maintain safeguarding the safety and security of
				individuals being monitored by CCTV and upholding their privacy
				and dignity. Previously, security camera analysis was done
				purely by people; - this was expensive regarding human resources
				and not time efficient. e.g., It took more than 24 hours for
				people to locate the Boston Bombing culprits due to the sheer
				size of camera footage and even more time to identify them.
				Artificial Intelligence is able to learn complex tasks and match
				facial features, possible weapons, etc., just as fast as humans
				if not faster. e.g. assessments were done examining the facial
				identification of experts and Artificial Intelligence and the
				results were comparable. Another part of security and prevention
				of crime that is being innovated by Artificial Intelligence is
				live footage observation. Artificial Intelligence being able to
				convey video as text. e.g., research is being done to create
				algorithms (and better them) to identify objects and people in
				image and video footage without human intervention.
			</p>
			<p class="text-body">
				Using security cameras during interrogations with the suspect
				also contains deeper evidence to report as it can indicate their
				behavioral reactions, suspicious attempts to escape, or even
				admitting to their own criminal acts. This manner is closely
				reviewed by Artificial Intelligence, making a documentation
				through sound analysis of the entire conversations through this
				media. Nowadays, artificial intelligence has the capability to
				speed up the process of lengthy reports, making it easier for
				police departments and law defenses to generate simplified and
				concise reports.
			</p>
			<h2 class="category">DNA Analysis</h2>
			<p class="text-body">
				Artificial Intelligence in robotic forensic DNA analysis is a
				valuable tool for law enforcement and forensic labs. "AI-driven
				robotic systems can also be used to analyze other types of
				forensic evidence, such as fingerprints, ballistics, and digital
				data." <b>(Frąckiewicz, 2023)</b>. Biological materials like
				blood, saliva and skin cells can be transferred through contact
				with objects and people during the commission of a crime.
				Advances in DNA technology now allow forensic scientists to
				analyze even small or degraded DNA samples, which was not
				possible before. This means old DNA evidence from crimes, like
				sexual assaults and cold cases, can now be analyzed even if it's
				decades old. Even tiny amounts of DNA can be detected due to how
				sensitive the technology is, even from multiple people involved.
				This relates to the <b>U.S. Department of Justice (2017)</b>,
				where it indicates two possible ways of DNA analysis being
				useful in criminal detection. An Artificial Intelligence System
				analyzes DNA evidence discovered at a crime scene, identifies
				the individuals connected to it and directs the law enforcement
				in tracking down suspects. DNA samples are subsequently
				cataloged in the DNA database, making it easier to identify and
				link any future criminal activities of suspects to their
				existing cases.
			</p>
			<p class="text-body">
				This aims to connect individuals to crime cases through forensic
				evidence like blood samples, hair, fingerprint or semen,
				increasing accuracy and helping authorities obtain leads to
				apprehend the criminals responsible.
			</p>
			<h2 class="category">Crime Forecasting</h2>
			<p class="text-body">
				According to the FBI, crime forecasting is based on past cases
				to formulate appropriate responses to present criminal
				activities <b>(Brewer, 2017)</b>. Nonetheless, this approach may
				not always prove effective, especially when machine learning
				lacks relevant information on the matter at hand.
				<b>Saeed & Abdulmohsin (2023)</b> describe crime forecasting as
				gathering a collection of historical criminal cases and using
				computer algorithms to closely analyze them to fully understand
				how individual's thought processes in the commission of crimes.
				As
				<b
					>Perry, W.L., McInnis, B., Price, C.C., Smith, S.,
					Hollywood, J.S. (2013)</b
				>
				suggests, “The operational value of predictive policing tools is
				in their contribution to broader law enforcement strategies that
				use the tools’ risk assessments to inform resource allocation
				and problem-solving decisions.” The concept of Artificial
				Intelligence in legal firms holds the potential to anticipate
				people's intentions to commit more serious crimes and identify
				suspicious individuals as well as having the criminals arrested.
				This leads to strengthened trust and connections between the
				community and law enforcement, offering peace of mind to
				citizens and a sense of security in their surroundings; while
				enabling the police to anticipate escape plans and illegal
				activities.
			</p>
			<p class="text-body">
				Video surveillances emerges as a valuable tool for conducting
				crime forecasting, as outlined by
				<b>Wu, G., Wu, Y., Jiao, L., Wang, Y.F., Chang, E.Y. (2003)</b>,
				this tool consists of three key phases: detection,
				representation, and recognition. With the help of this framework
				in the reduction of suspicious activities, contributing to more
				effective solutions in crime prevention. However, it is critical
				to note that this process can potentially introduce bias and may
				be influenced by incorrect intuitions in certain instances.
			</p>
			<p class="text-body">
				Although these are not the overall contribution of artificial
				intelligence in the law industry, because Artificial
				Intelligence systems are improving even the politics use this
				for gathering information taken from a company. Legal
				authorities use the invention to compile and store their
				criminal data for easier accessibility rather than manually
				locating a file from a storeroom.
