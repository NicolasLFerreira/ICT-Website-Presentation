			<p class="text-body">
				Before the invention of Artificial Intelligence, legal firms
				relied on analytic thinking and trusting their own intuition to
				determine the charges to be applied in criminal cases and decide
				on the appropriate legal actions. This approach led to a slow
				and often labor-intensive process, with some cases lingering
				unresolved due to insufficient concrete evidence. Keeping up
				with the workload was a significant challenge during this time.
				Today, legal professionals and law enforcement agencies have
				harnessed the power of scientific technology, specifically
				Artificial Intelligence, to make more efficient and effective
				working methods for their operations. This allows them to
				enhance their ability to work without worry. This is made
				possible by integrating automated tasks into Artificial
				Intelligence systems.

				According to <b>Joshi (2018)</b>, “the maintenance of law and
				order involves reducing crime rates and taking appropriate legal
				actions against those involved in criminal activities”. With the
				integration of Artificial Intelligence in this field, the
				process of successfully investigating and prosecuting crimes has
				become more precise. This technology facilitates the connection
				of criminal acts as evidence, to strengthen the prevention to
				crime and law enforcement. This perspective is further supported
				by

					Abbas, S., Nasir, Q. (2022)</b
				>, which highlights how Artificial Intelligence introduces
				innovative methods and predictive analysis for anticipating and
				addressing criminal activities.

				The legal industry has been significantly influenced by the idea
				of artificial intelligence. This is because it can process
				multiple workloads and develop quicker information, from case
				files to policies, far more efficiently than human lawyers ever
				could handle.

			<h2 class="category">
				Why did we choose this topic/technology as our proposal?
			</h2>
			<p class="text-body">
				As some may say that Artificial Intelligence improves the way of
				work, some would still be against the idea due to the technology
				taking over the nation, which just strengthens our decision into
				emphasizing the benefits and conflicts provided by this machine
				learning algorithm.
			</p>
			<p class="text-body">
				The advancement of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Law
				and Order has captivated our curiosity, encouraging us to dig
				deeper into a thorough analysis of the pros and cons. This
				exploration with the given scope piqued us on how Artificial
				Intelligence is transforming and enhancing the functions of law
				enforcement agencies while influencing the critical decisions
				made by the juries.
			</p>
			<p class="text-body">
				For Artificial Intelligence in the law industry, it became a
				valuable tool in preventing and solving current crimes.
				Artificial Intelligence provides solid evidence and even
				expediting the resolution of cases. However, it is intriguing
				when we consider how Artificial Intelligence, programmed to
				think like humans, can predict and counteract the strategies of
				criminals who plan their actions in advance. This implies
				pressure on criminals to make urgent decisions in contrast to
				Artificial Intelligence approach.
			</p>
			<p class="text-body">
				Apart from its role in criminal justice, Artificial Intelligence
				makes daily tasks in various areas more efficient. Although
				artificial intelligence can be used either in both sides, it is
				not just aiding in law enforcement but can also be used to
				support criminal activities especially when criminals are
				experienced in the Information Technology area. This concludes
				our reason for making this our main subject for our research.
				Our goal with this investigation is to gain a thorough
				understanding of how this evolving technology is reshaping the
				world of Law and Order. We aim to uncover how AI is impacting
				human activities in numerous ways, all within the context of
				accessible language and average terminology.
