			<p class="text-body">
				One of the big risks of using Artificial Intelligence in the
				criminal justice system is that depending on the data they were
				given to train; it may be biased. The Artificial Intelligence
				algorithms use a set of data to understand how to identify
				humans or objects based on the given data set such as images,
				tasks, patterns, scans and detections, etc. Due to Artificial
				Intelligence algorithms being based on data, the algorithm may
				be biased if the given data is biased. Artificial Intelligence
				systems are only good from the given data they are trained on
				and if the data is biased, then the result will be inaccurate
				which will lead to false positives and negatives in criminal
				investigations. Furthermore, AI algorithms can be used to make
				decisions without any human input. The absence of human
				oversight can lead to decisions that are not in line with
				ethical standards. In the criminal justice system, often
				involves situations where human judgement, empathy and
				understanding are crucial because every situation is different
				and needs careful thinking. If only the algorithm was to make
				the decisions, it can overlook these essential human elements,
				leading to decisions that lack compassion and a deep
				understanding of human experience. Artificial Intelligence could
				even violate privacy rights as the algorithms collect and
				analyze large amounts of data, which includes personal
				information.

				With increasing reliability of Artificial Intelligence, there is
				a potential loss of trust with this new technology due to
				previous cases that could have been influenced by Artificial
				Intelligence, leading to concerns about privacy and data
				security being compromised in the pursuit of information. In
				certain scenarios, evidence can be tampered with to mislead the
				law enforcement, potentially leading to wrongful convictions,
				unreliable outcomes and severe injustices against innocent
				individuals <b>(Frąckiewicz, 2023)</b>. This is similar to
				<b>Richmond (2020)</b> as she stated that how can the DNA
				analysis software be reliable and accurate when mixture of
				evidence traces is found, how will Artificial Intelligence base
				their actual findings.

				In retrieving CCTV footage for police custody is to discourage
				illegal activities and hold law enforcement accountable, it
				should not ignore an individual’s human rights.

				When Artificial Intelligence systems can help in gathering
				previous jury decisions, not all content can be relevant to the
				current case. In jury defenses, lawyers often come across
				situations where previous cases do not relate to the ones they
				are currently working on. Simply put this situation as a puzzle
				piece, being unable to connect with one section as it does not
				match. This becomes an issue for lawyers having to build a
				strong defense against their client’s sentences. So, lawyers
				must figure out which pieces from the old cases can help them in
				their new cases.

				In this video documentation made by
				<b>Click On Detroit (2023)</b>, the guest speaker informs the
				host about the concerns of police enforcement being replaced in
				doing their jobs. Although a lot of police work is done by
				nature and artificial intelligence has become unreliable in this
				case.

				In summary, Artificial Intelligence machines may occasionally
				prove unhelpful as it can be irrelevant information and possibly
				divert investigations in the wrong direction.
